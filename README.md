# Online Camera Calibration by Tracking Single Point with Gyroscope
Camera and gyroscope take part in standard hardware configuration of mobile devices and UAVs. Both these sensors are sensitive to angular variations. If the device rotates around itself, both gyroscope and camera are affected. While a gyroscope measures the change in the orientation of the device explicitly, the rotation of the device shifts the image points implicitly. The amount of the shift is determined by the rotation and the camera parameters. Roughly, for the same rotation, image points shift more if the focal length is larger or vice versa. Thus, by measuring the rotation via gyroscope, focal lengths and other intrinsic camera parameters can be estimated. Based on this hypothesis, in this work, we propose a novel camera auto-calibration method using a gyroscope. Unlike the other methods using homographies or optical flows on the images holistically, we use just a single point to track on multiple images and video frames. Other methods need some definite assumptions on the scene to detect optical flow or compute homography. On the other hand, our method is applicable as long as any key point exists to track in the scene. This flexibility makes it more robust and convenient for an online calibration.
